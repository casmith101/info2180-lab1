    I find web development interesting because I love design and I am always
    in awe after visiting a website that has smooth transitions and "cool" 
    functionality. I want to go into front-end software development or UX/UI 
    design in the future and so I am quite excited to learn more programming 
    languages that help to aid in building my knowledge and skill in that avenue.

    I am a christian and I love dogs. I am also a loyal samsung fan. My two favourite
